To begin writing JQuery, we need to include the library to the HTML
FI example is loading Jquery from Google's CDN
Script tag links HTML file to the JQuery library

<body>
  // other html here
  // other html here
  // other html here
  <p id="yo"> yo yo yo yo yo yo yo </p>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script>IN HERE IS WHERE WE WANT TO WRITE INLINE JQUERY. AT THE BOTTOM NEAR THE </body> TAG
  BECAUSE CODE TO WRITE IS DEPENDENT ON TAGS ALREADY BEING LOADED IN BROWSER</script>
  <script>
    $('#yo').append('hey hey hey hey!!!!!')
    //$ is a function equivalent to document.querySelectorAll
    //#yo is jquery selector, id='yo'
    //.append adds the text to the HTML element
    //although text after append appears on webpage, it wasn't explicitly added to the 'p' tag
  </script>
</body>
