*One of the biggest advantages an experienced programmer has is knowing how to quickly troubleshoot and fix
errors they encounter. You will reach this point â€” it's just a matter of practice.*

UNCAUGHT REFERENCEERROR: _____ IS NOT DEFINED
Tried to reference a variable or function that doesn't exist in current scope or scope chain
-double check where current thing is decalred
-make sure it's declared at a scope where scope chain includes outer scope that includes declaration of the
variable to access

UNCAUGHT TYPEERROR: _____ IS NOT A FUNCTION
Tried to invoke something not actually a function
-happens when variable contains undefined instead of function
-debug by finding attempted invocation occurrence and figure out why variable contains undefined

UNCAUGHT SYNTAXERROR: MISSING ) AFTER ARGUMENT LIST
Tried function invocation but forgot the closing parenthesis
-make sure indentations are lined up

UNCAUGHT TYPEERROR: ASSIGNMENT TO CONSTANT VARIABLE
Accidentally tried assigning new value to variable declared with CONST, prevents reassignment.
-could possibly be a typo
-maybe using assignment op = instead of strict equality op ===
