JavaScript contains many operators: +, !, <=, etc
Reserved words by language for specific purpose: function, for, debugger, etc
Everything else is data(7): numbers, strings, booleans, symbols, objects, null & undefined
6 of 7 JS data types are primitive, except object. They represent single values such as: 7, "hello" or false

NUMBERS: JavaScript has single, over-all 'number' type unlike other languages & their numbers of: integers, decimals, floats, etc
-typeof gives idea of what type of data dealt with, accepts 1 argument, piece of data we'd like to know type of

typeof 42 => "number"
typeof 3.14 => "number"
typeof -730 => "number"

STRINGS: represent text in JavaScript with single '', double quotes "", or backticks ``

typeof "What's your name?" => "string"
typeof 'My name is Malind Kowalski.' => "string"
typeof `Nice to meet you, Malind!` => "string"
typeof "" => "string"

BOOLEANS: 1 of 2 values of true or false, role of logical control flow & looping in JS

typeof true => "boolean"
typeof false => "boolean"

OBJECTS: a collection of properties bound by curly braces {}, can point to values of any data type even objects

{
  'firstName': 'Malind',
  'lastName': 'Kowalski',
  'birthdate': {
    'month': 'July',
    'date': 30,
    'year': 1991
  },
  'state': 'Colorado'
}
typeof {} => "object"

NULL: represents absent object although typeof returns object when called on null
typeof null => "object"

UNDEFINED: misnomer, instead of 'not defined' more like 'not yet assigned value'
typeof undefined => "undefined"
