Looping is process of executing set of statements repeatedly until condition is met

Iteration is process of executing a set of statements once for each element in a collection
var myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'];

var j = 0;

while (j < myArray.length) {
  console.log(myArray[j++]);
}

FOR...OF
-Introduced in ES2015, no initialization, no condition, no incrementing counter, no bracket notation
-No such reassignment
-Use any time to iterate oer an array
const myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'];

for (const element of myArray) {
  console.log(element);
}

ITERATING OVER OBJECTS
FOR...IN
-Iterates over properties in ab object but doesn't pass entire property into block, instead it passes the
key
-Use whenever you want to enumerate the properties of an object
-Rule: don't use FOR...IN with arrays
for (const <KEY> in <OBJECT>) {
  // Code in the statement body
}

const address = {
  street1: '11 Broadway',
  street2: '2nd Floor',
  city: 'New York',
  state: 'NY',
  zipCode: 10004
};

for (const key in address) {
    console.log(key);
}

LOG: street1
LOG: street2
LOG: city
LOG: state
LOG: zipCode
