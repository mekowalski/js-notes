In JavaScript the use of XMLHttpRequest directly accesses remote data or web APIs but requires a lot of lower
level wiring to get everything working

POSTMAN AND GITHUB API(DONE)
-Postman is an easy to use Chrome extension that allows making of different web requests
-Working with Github API to retrieve information about jQuery Github repository
-Postman displays JSON list of the URL entered in the textbox
eg: enter in URL textbox - https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/commits
    Postman will display JSON formatted results
    -Can ask Github API to returm only commits made by a certain author(or ask any API to return anything)

DEFINING APIs
-An application programming interface(API) is a set of routines, protocols and tools for building software
and applications
-In relation to OOP, an API is a class and the list of methods defined for that class
-List or URLs provided on Github Developer site acts as public methods into their system
-Developers creating the API control which resources shared and who has access
-Github(specifically) API forgoes HTML/CSS/JS to serve up pure data

AJAX
-Asynchronous JavaScript & XML(AJAX) is a technique that is used in web applications
-Provides retrieval of content from server and displays it without a page refresh
-This allows a better user experience by allowing users to manipulate data on the server and see results
without page refreshes
-With jQuery there is a set of AJAX related functions to make dynamic updating easier

*ajax and callbacks edits in: index.html, sentence.html & script.js*
Remote data can come from anywhere, even your own server, it just means it directly isn't included in the
current page
We used power of AJAX to load data from 'sentence.html' file to display in browser

CALLBACKS
Using callbacks allows code to make request and continue doing other things until request is completed
AJAX is an asynchronous pattern which is non-blocking, meaning it doesn't sit around and wait fr request to
finish before running all the code
Real world example:
  -Put food in oven
  -You don't stand and wait for food to cook
  -You can do other things while food cooks in oven such as cleaning up the mess that was made or drink some
  wine or browse the internet or take a power nap
  -When food is done the timer beeps and you remove food and eat it
  ^^this final step is how callbacks work

HANDLING PROBLEMS
What happens if an API used doesn't respond or doesn't exist?
A good developer will make sure to handle these unexpected events gracefully when using AJAX
Can provide multiple callbacks with jQuery: 1 for successful response and 1 for errors
