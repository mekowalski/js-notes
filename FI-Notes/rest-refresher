Roy Thomas Fielding came up with REST, REpresentational State Transfer as a standard way web applications
should structure their URLs
eg:
  -Logging into a social media account
  -Getting repository data from Github
  -Having something in app post to Twitter
  -Pulling a feed of images from Instagram
  -Even calling list of locations from Google Maps


RESTful systens are centered on the idea of a resource
Real world example
  -You open a page with a blank form you use to make a new account
    In terms of REST this represents a 'new resource'
  -You fill out the form and click submit, any information is sent to the application server and is saved in
  the database, creating your new account
    In terms of REST this represents a 'create resource'
  -After the server saves your account it redirects you the the page to view your account
    In terms of REST this represents 'show resource'
  -You decide to add a photo to your account or change your username/password
    In terms of REST this represents 'edit resource'
  -You change the info wanted to change and submit the form, on the server side, the new info is applied to
  your account
    In terms of REST this represents 'update resource'
  -Finally you want to browse other accounts and ask for a list of those accounts
    In terms of REST this represents 'index pf resource'

Most systems follow a standard pattern for routing types of requests made
Four key actions the system has: CRUD
  Create
  Read
  Update
  Destroy
  and an INDEX so five routes
  a form for creating and a form for updating so seven routes total


HTTP VERBS AND REST
GET: we view a readable source that doesn't need change on the server
POST: encloses data with the request that the server will use to create the requested resource
PATCH: to update an existing resource, that also encloses data to identify existing resource update
and update attributes
DELETE: to destroy a resource, will request resource identifier, find it and delete it

PUT should be used if an entire resource is being replaced
PATCH should be used to update a resource


ROUTES
The combination of an HTTP verb and URI
Some examples:
GET /accounts
//show all accounts

POST /accounts
//create a new account

GET /accounts/new
//render form for creating new account

PATCH /accounts/:id
//show specific account

DELETE /accounts/:id
//delete specific account
