CSS has frameworks with styling already taken care of, both curse and blessing:
  -save a lot of time by following framework conventions and styling
  -giving up customization

Frameworks provide a slew of classes that can be used to style the application
-classes allow reuse of styling across several components.

BASSCSS
-very lightweight CSS framework focusing on sane defaults and more complex layout possibilities
-not all-in-one framework like Bootstrap or Foundation but helps lay out application in better way

TYPOGRAPHY
-BASSCSS has default styles for all typographic elements (p, h1, h2, ul, div, etc)
-less styling to worry about

GRID
-in BASSCSS grid has standard 12 column layout system that is also in Bootstrap, Foundation and other
frameworks
-foregoing this grid layout gives flexbox layout, helping solve many problems

FLEXBOX
-relatively new concept that more developers are starting to use, allowing for powerful layout solutions that
can't be achieved with traditional layout techniques
-BASSCSS provides layout classes that can create any kind of layout necessary
-elements can align themselves with flexbox shrink/stretch
-considered close to Golden Age of web layout
