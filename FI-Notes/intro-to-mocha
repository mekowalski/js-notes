Group together the tests into suites that contain both other suites and tests to allow organization

Mocha exposes a few methods to write the tests with, the 2 common ones are:
  -describe(): allows definition of a suite, 1st argument is the name of the suite
  -it(): function that is the actual test, takes in a string as 1st argument about what to test & a function
  that contains an assertion(.expect) that compares written code to expected outcome

To run certain code before or after the test runs, we use:
  -before() or before every test- beforeEach()
  -after() or after every test- afterEach()

  -any of these^^ functions can have an optional 1st argument, a function usually called 'done' by convention

jsdom: simulates a browser in testing environment which mocks out objects and behaviors as if browser was
 present

jsdom.env() is a function called and receives 4 arguments:
  -an HTML string to set up DOM
  -an array of paths to source files
  -a callback function (usually in Node.js fashion) receives an error first, the 'err' will mostly be 'null'
  but if defined, 'done(err)' will tell Mocha to stop and show what's wrong.  If things go well then all
  things defined are taken on 'window' and added to 'global' to be call in the tests

-Test will have a function named and the 'it' block will declare in plain English the expectation to test
-The 'expect' block calls the function behind the tests and uses a matcher(.toBe) to test what return value
of the function should be

TEST WALKTHROUGH
describe('faveIceCream', () => {
  it ('should return the correct sentence when passed an icecream flavor', () => {
    const result = faveIceCream("Ben & Jerry's Americone Dream")
    const expectedResult = "I love Ben & Jerry's Americone Dream"
    expect(result).toBe(expectedResult)
  })
})
-Tests a function name faveIceCream
-IT block declares in plain english the expectation being tested
-EXPECT block calls the function behind tests and uses matcher(.toBe) to test the return value of function
-EXPECT calls faveIceCream function and passes param of "Ben & Jerry's Americone Dream" as if running a real
 application


THE DEBUGGER
-Invokes any available debugging functionality such as setting a breakpoint(MDN)
eg: see what an argument looks like
  function faveIceCream(flavor {
    debugger
  })
