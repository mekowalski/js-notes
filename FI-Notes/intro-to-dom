DOM: Document Object Model

Concluding that by changing Document Object Model, we change the way our webpage displays
And can do this even if HTML is unchanged

DOM is a representation of current view of the browser and can be manipulated without reloading the page
The HTML is the test in a file first used to display the page

With JavaScript we can view a current rep of the DOM & we can select specific portions of DOM to manipulate
