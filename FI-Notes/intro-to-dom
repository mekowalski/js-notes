DOM: Document Object Model

Concluding that by changing Document Object Model, we change the way our webpage displays
And can do this even if HTML is unchanged

DOM is a representation of current view of the browser and can be manipulated without reloading the page
The HTML is the test in a file first used to display the page

With JavaScript we can view a current rep of the DOM & we can select specific portions of DOM to manipulate
-view-source:https://thewebsitehere.fake/pagenine/somerestful-routes
-Browser reads this HTML, along with CSS and JS to create the DOM
-view-source tab looks very similar to HTML
-The browser seems to display the HTML layout but it is actually displaying Document Object Model of
 respective page
