-Web Users expect sites to load quickly and stay updated
-Research shows 40% of site visitors will leave if site takes longer than 3 seconds to load
-Mobile users are even less patient

AJAX keeps users engaged
  1. Deliver and initial engaging page using HTML/CSS
  2. Use JS to add more to the DOM behind the scenes

AJAX relies on:
  -Promises
  -XMLHttpRequestObject(s)
  -Serialization format JSON
  -Asynchromous Input/Output
  -Event Loop


FETCH DATA WITH FETCH()
-FETCH() function retrieves data globally on the WINDOW object
eg:
  fetch('string representing URL to data resource')
    .then(response => response.json)
    .then(json => etcetera)
-First argument is a STRING that represents the URL providing some data
-Chain a call to .THEN() at the end of FETCH()

-THEN() First: takes a function telling JS to ask network response to be turned into JSON
-THEN() Final: actually get JSON passed in and do something with it, console.log or hand the JSON off to
        another function
eg:
  fetch('http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json))
-In the DevTools console, the chain will return a method called Promise
  >Promise {<pending>}
  >{number: 6, message: "success", people: Array(6)}
  >Fetch finished loading GET "http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json"
