*JavaScript objects are a collection of properties bounded by curly braces {}, similar to a Ruby hash
The properties can point to values of any data type â€” even other objects.*

 Can have empty objects: {}
 Objects with single key-value pair: {key: value}
 Objects with multiple key-value pairs: {key1: value1, key2: value2}

EXAMPLE:
const malind = {
  firstName: 'Malind',
  lastName: 'Kowalski',
  city: 'Durango'.
  state: 'Colorado',
  zipCode: 81301
};

-Real data of object is stored in value half of key-value pairings, key gives us access to value
-Use identifiers to name variables and functions, inside an Object each value is assigned a key
-Can then refer to key and JS engine knows which value to access


ACCESS VALUE STORED IN OBJECT
Dot Notation uses a period (.) to access values in an object
Simple to read, preferred usage to access properties
  -malind.lastName; => "Kowalski"
  -malind.zipCode; => 81301
  *lastName and zipCode are defined and given value therefore accessible

Accessing nonexistent property will return undefined because of no matching key on object
  -malind.faveColor; => undefined
  *faveColor isn't defined therefore an UNDEFINED error is thrown
  *keep in mind, good indicator to recheck which Object properties exist

Bracket Notation uses [] to access values of an object
  -malind['firstName']; => "Malind"
  -malind['city']; => "Durango"

A bit harder to read
Works better if key is nonstandard
const wildKeys = {
  'Cash rules everything around me.': 'Wu',
  'C.R.E.A.M.': 'Tang',
  'Get the money.': 'For',
  "$ $ bill, y'all!": 'Ever'
};

wildKeys["Get the money"]; => "For"
*In order to access property via dot notation, key must follow same naming rules applied to variables
and functions
*All keys are strings

*Keeping everything standardized is good, and being able to access properties via dot notation is much
more readable*
eg:
-camelCaseEverything
-start key with lowercaseLetter
-noSpacesOrPunctuation


ACCESS PROPERTIES DYNAMICALLY
Bracket notation has ability to compute value of variables on the fly
const meals = {
  breakfast: 'Oatmeal',
  lunch: 'Caesar salad',
  dinner: 'Chimichangas'
};

let mealName = 'lunch';

meals[mealName]; => "Caesar salad"

-Dot notation doesn't work
-JS doesn't treat declared variable as a variable, it checks whether the property of the keyName
 exists
 eg: only properties of breakfast, lunch, dinner will return and mealName will be defined


ADDING PROPERTIES TO AN OBJECT
Add properties to an object with dot or bracket notation
const caroga = {};

caroga.firstName = "Caroga"
caroga['lastName'] = "Kowalski"
caroga.city = "Durango"
caroga['state'] = "Colorado"
caroga.zipCode = 81301

caroga; => {firstName: 'Caroga', lastName: 'Kowalski', city: 'Durango', state: 'Colorado',
zipCode: 81301}

Multiple properties can have same value but keys must be unique
eg:
const names = {
  firstName: 'Caroga',
  lastName: 'Kowalski',
  familyName: 'Kowalski'
}

CAN DESTRUCTIVELY MODIFY OBJECT
function destructivelyUpdateObject (obj, key, value) {
  obj[key] = value;

  return obj;
}

ALTHOUGH IT'S BETTER TO COPY ALL OLD OBJECT INTO NEW OBJECT
function nondestructivelyUpdateObject(obj, key, value) {
  const newObj = { ...obj };

  newObj[key] = value;

  return newObj;
}

*This is a lot of code for both mays to modify and JavaScript has a better way*

OBJECT.ASSIGN()
Allows combination of properties from multiple objects in single object
First argument passed in the initial object which all properties are merges
Additional arguments are properties we ant to merge into first object

Object.assign(initialObject, additionalObject, additionalObject, ...);

Common pattern is to provide empty object as 1st argument
Composes an entirely new object instead of modifying/overwriting existing object
Also allows rewrite without destruction

function nondestructivelyUpdateObject(obj, key, value) {
  return Object.assign({}, obj, { [key]: value });
}

Important to merge everything into new empty object.

DELETING A PROPERTY FROM AN OBJECT
Pass property to remove with delete operator and JavaScript takes care of the rest
delete object.property; => true

Arrays are a special type of OBJECT
For accessing elements of array always use integers
Be wary of setting object-style properties on an array
All object keys and array indexes are strings
