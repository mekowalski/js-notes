HTML is a markup language for webpages
DOM Nodes represent all components that make up a web page
Nodes are elements that have a starting and ending tag
Some only have a starting tag called self-closing elements which don't have content nested inside of them,
more so they're void elements

NORMAL TAG:
<p>I'm a paragraph.</p>

NESTED TAG:
<body>
  <main>
    <p>I am a Paragraph tag, nested inside a Main element, nested inside the Body!</p>
  </main>
</body>

SELF-CLOSING TAG, TRAILING OPTIONAL
-These elements don't have any content inside of them (more technically called VOID elements), therefore they
 can't be parent nodes
eg:
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6MbkZSYy4mI3gLYc/giphy.gif" alt="A policeman">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6MbkZSYy4mI3gLYc/giphy.gif" alt="A policeman" />

DOM structure is like a tree, one big trunk and all other elements sprout from trunk
Those elements can also have children themselves leading to a branched structure
Most elements begin at <body>
<body>
  <main>
    <p>I'm a paragraph in the main element which is in the body!</p>
  </main>
</body>

Every HTML element has a display value that can be: none(hides element), block or inline

BLOCK ELEMENTS
Block elements start a new line and stretch horizontally, take up available width and used for layout
purposes
Many block elements but some are: <div>, <h1>, <form>, <main>, <p>

INLINE ELEMENTS
Inline elements are shy and compact, they only contain text and other inline elements.
Best to avoid adding block and inline elements because browser will appear wonky
Some examples of inline elements: <span>, <em>, <strong>, <a>, <img>
