A big part of making DOM manipulation quick and painless is via selecting the correct DOM node you want to
work with

When using JQuery wrap selectors ('in strings') in a call to $ such as:
$('div')

To set up JQuery selector, you always begin with $, every line of JQuery should begin with $
$('selector-goes-here')
*there are many types of selectors*

ELEMENT SELECTORS
$('img'): will return array of all images

CLASS SELECTORS
$('.pics'): use dot for class denotation, this will return elements with class of .whatever

ID SELECTORS
$('#baby-ninja'): works the same as class selector but # denotes the id

DESCENDANT SELECTOR
$('ul li'): helps select all list items inside ul tag, the li tags are descendants

FIRST CHILD
$('parent-tag child-tag:first-child'): returns the first selected tag inside each div

ALT TAG SELECTOR
$("img[alt='the beatles making faces']"): selects image with specific alt text ie. the beatles making faces

LAST SELECTOR
$('div:last'): returns last selected part of the page
