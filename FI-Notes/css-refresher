-Standard HTML without any mockup creates default styles that are incredibly dull, making HTML look like
 a document
-Nowadays HTML is used for apps, games and more, barely resembling documents

CSS: cascading style sheets, is a language that allows specification of what element should look like

p {
  font-size: 15px;
  color: yellow;
}
*this tells browser that in the <p> tags, the font should 15pixels and color yellow*

CSS framework allows us to have custom styling without writing any, or a lot, CSS ourselves
-Not too concerned with writing much CSS but UNDERSTANDING how CSS  and its selectors work is important
-Utilize classes the framework provides
-99% of CSS in any application is usually declared in external sheets, referenced by <link> tag in the
 <head> of document
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
*Sometimes, if not declared in an external stylesheet, CSS can be declared in the <head> or inline on a
 specific DOM element.  This way of styling should be avoided though, stylesheets should be responsible
 for STYLE not .js files*

An element can match several selectors and the properties of the selectors can overwrite each other
body {
  font-size: 24px;
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
*font size will inherit 24px and a red color, ruleset for making <p> red has precedence since its selector
is more specific.*


CLASSES AND ID'S
Can add class and id attributes to DOM nodes to make it easier to work with styling.

.red {
  color: red;
}

<p>
  I am a <span class="red">paragraph</span> with some red <span class="red">words</span>.
</p>

Can add multiple classes to same HTML element
.red {
  color: red;
}

.big {
  font-size: 24px;
}

<p>
  I am a <span class="red big">paragraph</span> with some red <span class="red big">words</span>.
</p>


ID's are used to specifically target one element and an id can only be used once in entire DOM
<p id="paragraph">I am a paragraph.</p>  //valid

<p id="paragraph">I am a paragraph.</p>  //invalid
<p id="paragraph">I am another paragraph.</p>  //invalid


SELECTORS
Selectors are identifiers to select the element needed to style
-tag: <p>, <div> tec
-class: .red
-id: #exact-id


SELECTOR SPECIFICITY
Any CSS declaration has a certain weight attached to it determined by selector type; some selectors are
more specific and higher up in priority list
p { //generic, nothing specific
  font-size: 14px;
}

.bigger { //a class selector has more weight therefore font size goes up to 16px
  font-size: 16px;
}

#paragraph { //id takes precedence over the tag selector therefore font size goes up to 24px
  font-size: 24px;
}


USING JS TO SELECT DOM NODES
JS example to select 'red' class:
const redElements = document.querySelectorAll('.red')  //returns all 'red' class listed
const redElements = document.querySelector('.red')  //returns first matching 'red' class

JQuery example:
const redElements = $('.red')  //returns an array of 'red' class

Can also select multiple elements:
const boldElementsAndRedParagraphs = document.querySelectorAll('.big, .red p')
