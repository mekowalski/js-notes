Don't ever want to write JavaScript and JQuery inside HTML files, want separation of code and responsibilities

SEPARATING AND LINKING
Want to remove JQuery out of HTML file and into script.js file

-Want to load script.js in the index.html file
-JS files grow larger with more interactive apps and pages take longer to load
-This is due to browser loading EVERYTHING in between <head> before attempting to render the page
-Then the browser gets to the <body> and loads synchronously
-When browser encounters <script> tags, it needs to evaluate the script or make a request to the location
 specified in the <script> tag's src attribute

In HTML file include <script> tag for script.js file
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> My Site </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p id="text">jQuery is so cool. It lets me add text to my page programmatically. </p>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

DOCUMENT READY
In .js file we need to set document ready in order to detect when HTML page has loaded and the document will
be ready for manipulation
$(document).ready(function() {
  //code to be executed here
})

Once 'load' event fires(tell jQuery to listen for with $(document).ready()) the rest of the code will fire.
