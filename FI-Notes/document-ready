Don't ever want to write JavaScript and JQuery inside HTML files, want separation of code and responsibilities

SEPARATING AND LINKING
Want to remove JQuery out of HTML file and into script.js file
When browser encounters <script> tags, it needs to evaluate the script or make a request to the location
specified in the <script> tag's src attribute

In HTML file include <script> tag for script.js file
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> My Site </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p id="text">jQuery is so cool. It lets me add text to my page programmatically. </p>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

DOCUMENT READY
In .js file we need to set document ready in order to detect when HTML page has loaded and the document will
be ready for manipulation
$(document).ready(function() {
  //code to be executed here
})

Once 'load' event fires the rest of the code will fire.
