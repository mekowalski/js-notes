WHY HANDELBARS?
-Logic-less template engine dynamically generating the HTML page
-Adds minimal logic due to helpers
 eg: if, with, unless, each, etc

-Can be loaded into browser like any other JS file
 eg: <script src='/path/to/handlebars.min.js'></script>

PROS OF USING HANDLEBARS
-Keeps HTML page clean while separating logic-less templates from actual logic in JS files which improves
 structure of application along with its maintainability and scalability
-Simplifies task of manually updating data on the view
-Uses popular frameworks and platforms such as Ember.js, Meteor.js and Ghost
