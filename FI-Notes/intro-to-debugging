An essential practice for debugging is tracing
Tracing: uses an output statement (ie: console.log()) to provide feedback about what the machine is thinking

-Common requests are regarding behavior, processes and sometimes it doesn't quite give what is wanted
-Debugging traces the program for steps on how the issue came to be

CONSOLE OBJECT FOR DEBUGGING
-The browser(not JS language) provides an object called console
-console: object with specific methods that send text to DevTools logging area, commonly known as the console
-.log() method enters/records/logs general info to the console, with a number of arguments
 eg:
 console.log('hello', 'world') => hello world

-Can log, Strings, Numbers and Objects
-Use of console.log() in code snippets preface with LOG: to differentiate messages logged out to console
 from values returned by an expression
 eg:
 function logReturner() {
  console.log(false);

  return true
 }

 logReturner();
 LOG: false
 => true
