When a function is invoked as a method of an object, THIS equals the object receiving the method call
JavaScript allows setting of THIS equal to whatever we want
function greet() {
  console.log(`hey, my name is ${this.name}!`)
}

let malind = {name: 'Malind'}

greet.apply(malind) => hey, my name is Malind!
greet.call(malind) => hey, my name is Malind!

Both CALL and APPLY give us a way to invoke a function & explicitly set THIS equal to the first argument of
CALL or APPLY

Difference of CALL and APPLY is the way arguments are passed to target function
CALL()
When we invoke greet, we explicitly set THIS but also pass values for the 2 arguments
Using CALL we pass the object THIS as the first argument followed by any function arguments in order

function greet(person1, person2) {
  console.log(`Hello ${person1} and ${person2}!  My name is ${this.name}, great to meet yall!`)
}

let malind = {name: 'Malind'}

greet.call(malind, 'Kristopher', 'Ryan')
=> Hello Kristopher and Ryan!  My name is Malind, great to meet yall!
*if no arguments are passed we see undefined in both argument places*

APPLY()
Similar to CALL but only takes in 2 arguments: the value of THIS and the array of arguments to pass to the
target function

greet.apply(malind, ['Kristopher', 'Ryan'])
=> Hello Kristopher and Ryan!  My name is Malind, great to meet yall!

BIND()
Bind is similar to CALL but has a couple differences:
  -Set functions value to THIS value but delay calling the function until later
  -BIND() creates a new function the same capabilities as original function

let malind = {name: 'Malind'}

function greet(person) {
  console.log(`Hi there ${person}, my name is ${this.name}!`)
}

let newGreet = greet.bind(malind)
*bind does not change original function, it copies the function and sets the copied function's THIS context
to whatever is passed through as an argument to bind*

newGreet('Christine') => Hi there Christine, my name is Malind!

greet('Christine') => Hi there Christine, my name is !
