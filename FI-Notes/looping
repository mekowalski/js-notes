Loops are used to execute same code block a specified number of times.
WHILE and FOR are the 2 main loops in JavaScript

FOR LOOP
-Most common loop
-Use for loop when you know exact number of times to run loop
for ([initialization]; [condition]; [iteration]) {
  [loop body]
}
-Initialization: begin a counter variable
-Condition: expression evaluated before passing through each loop
 -If expression evaluates to true, statements in loop are executed
 -If expression evaluates to false, loop exits
-Iteration: statement executed at the end of each iteration, bringing loop closer to completion
-Loop body: code that runs on each pass through the loop

const dogs = ['Caroga', 'Titan', 'Chief'];

function goodDog(dogs) {
  for (let i = 0; i < dogs.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Who's a good dog? ${dogs[i]}'s a good dog!'`);
  }
  return dogs;
}
goodDog(dogs); => Who's a good dog? Caroga's a good dog!'
                  Who's a good dog? Titan's a good dog!'
                  Who's a good dog? Chief's a good dog!'
                  (3) ["Caroga", "Titan", "Chief"]

L7: let i = 0 is the INITIALIZATIN, use LET instead of CONST because value needs to be incremented
L7: i < dogs.length is the CONDITION
  1. run code in loop until i is not less than gods length
  2. as long as condition evaluates to true, execute code then reevaluate condition
  3. as soon as condition evaluates to false, exit loop


WHILE LOOP
-Designed to loop an indefinite amount of times, keeps looping WHILE condition is true or UNTIL condition
is false
-Use when we do't know how many times to run loops
while ([condition]) {
  [loop body]
}

let countdown = 10;

while (countdown > 0) {
  console.log(--countdown);
}
