Three logical operators:
  -NOT !
  -AND &&
  -OR ||

NOT is also called bang operator, operates single expression, returning opposite/inverse of truthiness
  !true; => false
  !false; => true

Double!! converts any value into a boolean
  !!false; => false
  !!true; => true

AND op takes 2 expressions to return true or false
  -if both expressions are true then true is returned
  true && true => true

  -if either expression is true or false then false is returned
  true && false => false

OR op takes 2 expressions, return value is always 1 of the 2 expressions.
  -if first expression is true then return value of FIRST expression
  7 + 30 || 'Whatever' => 37

  -if first expression is false then return the SECOND expression
  7 > 30 || 'Whatever' => "Whatever"

-Link conditions with && and || operators often used to link multiple conditions in a statement
-Logical ops are powerful backbone of JS with most website logic based on
