  switch around the numerical values in the array to display the items form lowest to highest values
  example: 4, 2 to be 2, 4

  grab a specific item in the numbers array and place that into a new numbers

  compare first number to see if it is greater than the next numbers (3 > 4 ??)
  create an iteration to move largest number of sub array to the right hand side.
   [3,2,4,1,5] (5 > 1) ?? yes
  if greater ->
    then swap numbers in array
  else ->
    leave it alone

RULES:

  1. No Google
  2. No build in enumerators (.mpa, .sort, .forEach) -> only for (var i) loops
  3. Must write pseudo code first. Think solve it in english and then solve the JS syntax.
  4. Think out loud, talk outloud, be yourself.
