Null VS Undefined

-Both data types in Javascript
-Javascript never sets a value to Null

console.log(typeof null)
return => object

console.log(typeof undefined)
return => undefined

console.log(null === undefined)
return => false
null does not have same identity as undefined

console.log(null == undefined)
return => true
Javascript considers null & undefined to be equal

! changes to true
!! changes to false

console.log(1 + null)
return => 1
null is zero

console.log(1 + undefined)
return => Nan(not a number)
can't add to undefined because it's not a number
