Strict mode tightens rules for certain behavior
-Sometimes can keep code safer & help JavaScript engines perform optimizations

-Use Strict directive, two ways to use strict mode
1. 'use strict'; as first line in your file
2. apply strict mode to individual functions by putting 'use strict' at first line of function
function myFunction() {
  'use strict';
  x = 730;
}

-Strict mode converts mistakes or bad syntax into real errors
-In normal JS mistyping variable name created new global variable
-In strict mode mistyping variable will throw an error, impossible to create global variable
function myFunction() {
  'use strict';
  x = 730'  //this will create error in strict mode, must first declare variable with VAR, const or let before assigning value
}

-In SM, deleting variable is not allowed, only in normal JS mode
-Normal JS, developer will not get error feedback assigning values to non writable properties
-In SM, any assignment to non writable property, getter only prop, non existing prop, non existing variable or non existing object will result in error
var x = 073091;
delete x;
return => false

var object = {};
Object.defineProperty(object, 'x', {value:0, writable:false});
object.x = 730;
//will return error

var obj = {get x() {return 0}};  //should only be able to get
obj.x = 730;  //not assign it a new value
//will throw error

delete Object.prototype
//SM makes attempting to delete an non-deletable property error out
//in normal it would not delete, just doesn't have effect

-In SM function params names must be unique
function sum(a, a, c) {  //can't have two a's as params, probably a mistake/typo
  'use strict';
  return a + b + c;
}

-Changes to WITH and EVAL
-WITH extends scope chain for a statement, SM prohibits WITH completely, makes optiomization better
var x = 15;
with (obj) {
  x;  //is this var x or obj.x?
}

-In SM EVAL doesn't introduce new variables into surrounding scope
-In SM EVAL creates variable only for code being evaluated, EVAL can't effect whether name refers to outer or local variable
Normal code
eval('var x;')  //introduces variable into surrounding function or global scope
SM code
eval('var x;')  //var x is only going to exist in parenthesis of code, outside there won't be var

var x = 15;
var evalX = eval("'use strict'; var x = 45; x;");  //normal JS x = 45 will change original x = 15
console.assert(x === 15);  //in SM this will still be x = 17
return => true

console.assert(evalX === 45);  //in SM this will now be x = 45
return => true

-Secure JavaScript, SM helps to easily write secure js
-Not possible to reference window object through THIS inside SM function
-SM makes it impossible to access most recently called function & arguments
-SM has security advantages & it helps with errors, SM is recommended for your code
