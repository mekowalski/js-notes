const VS let VS var
-Ways to define variables in JavaScript
-const and let were introduced in ES6 but var has been around since beginning

-Const, for values that never change
const Pi = 3.14
Pi return => 3.14

Pi = 1
return => Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

-Let, for clock level variables
-When defining with let, it's only available within the block that's defined

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  //for loops always in block, this is a block inside curly braces
  console.log(i);
}
return => 0
          1
          2
//locking that variable assigned with let

console.log(i);  //if tried to run this before or after loop, it will error
return => Uncaught ReferenceError: 1 is not defined

-Var, variables available to entire function or if not within function then to the entire program
-When defined with var, it will return undefined, not error out
-Variable will be available even before assignment, knows existence but hasn't been assigned yet
for (var j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
  console.log(j);
}
return => 0
          1
          2

console.log(j)  //even though this log is after the loop, it is still logged
return => 3
