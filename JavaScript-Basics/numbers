Numbers

-Can do standard mathematical operations
-Can also be done with decimals
-Numbers eventually rounded off, doesn't go on forever

var number = 3;
console.log(number);
return => 3

+ 2 return => 5

- 2 return => 1

* 2 return => 6

/ 2 return => 1.5

% 2 (modulus operator gives remainder)
return => 1
2 goes into 3, 1 time with a remainder of 1

var num = 12;
console.log(num % 7)
return => 5
7 goes into 12, 1 time with a remainder of 5

increment/decrement
var num = 5;
num++;
return => 6

num--;
return => 4

-in console, the increment/decrement/operative number is new value for variable but for this example i'm keeping `num = 5`
num += 5 return => 10
num -= 3 return => 2
num *= 3 return => 15
num /= 2 return => 2.5
