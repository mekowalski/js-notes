While & Do While

-Both allow you to repeat code

-While loop creates loop that executes specified statement as long as test condition to true and condition is evaluated before executing the statement
-Does not automatically increment counter like for loop, make sure to do that inside the loop
var n = 0;
while (n < 5) { //while n is less than 5, while this is true
  n++;  //this will run, add 1 to n
  console.log('n = ' + n);  //this will run, log n = n
}
return => n = 1
          n = 2
          n = 3
          n = 4
          n = 5
          undefined

-Do While loop is similar EXCEPT is creates loop that executes until test condition evaluates to false
-Condition statement evaluated after executing statement resulting in statements running at least once
-Key difference is code in curly brace will always run at least once then see the while statement
var i = 0;
do {
  i++;
  console.log('i = ' + i);
} while (i < 5);
return => i = 1
          i = 2
          i = 3
          i = 4
          i = 5
          undefined

-Can use continue, means to not run any code after that command just go to next iteration of loop
var n = 0;
while (n < 5) { //while n is less than 5, while this is true
  n++;  //this will run, add 1 to n

  if (n == 3) continue;
  console.log('n = ' + n);  //this will be skipped
}
return => n = 1
          n = 2
          n = 4
          n = 5
          // n = 3 did not return because the code after (n==3) was skipped

-Can also use break, jump out of loop completely, won't run anymore iterations
var n = 0;
while (n < 5) { //while n is less than 5, while this is true
  n++;  //this will run, add 1 to n

  if (n == 3) break;
  console.log('n = ' + n);  //this will only be run twice
}
return => n = 1
          n = 2
          undefined
          // remaining loop has stopped once (n == 3)

-If you made a loop that accidentally goes forever, it could freeze browser and could crash it
-If using Chrome, go to Task Manager and end the process
