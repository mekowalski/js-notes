-Double = test for abstract equality
-Attempt to resolve data types via type coercion before making comparison
console.log(3 == '3');
return => true
string 3 is converted to number 3 before comparison made

console.log(true == '1');
return => true
in Javascript true is 1 and false is 0

console.log('This is a string' == new String('This is a string'));
return => true


-Triple = test for strict equality
-Will return false if types are different
console.log(3 === '3');
return => false
types are different, number and string, therefore false

console.log(true === '1');
return => false
1 is not converted therefore false

console.log('This is a string' === new String('This is a string'));
return => false
string literals are different from string objects

-If need to compare values of different types, first do conversions yourself then compare
-Makes code more explicit, always better
-Triple = will test strict equality therefore provides clarity for code
-Prevent any false positives caused by abstract equality comparison
