AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
-In current programming, XML is now substituted with JSON (Javascript Object Notation) but AJAX kept the X in the acronym because AJAJ would just sound odd.
-Allows update parts of website without reloading entire page
-Recieve from and send data to a server behind the scenes

//CSS file
<h1>AJAX with Me!</h1>
<p id='demo'>Let AJAX change this text</p>
<button type='button' onclick='loadDoc()'>Change Content</button>

//JS file
function loadDoc() {
  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); //step 2
  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
      document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = this.responseText; //step 6(.responseText) & 7(.innerHTML)
    }
  }
  xhttp.open('GET', 'https:this.is.a/URL-for-web-server', true); //step 3
  xhttp.send(); //step 3
}

-1. An event occurs on a web page, so event would be when button is clicked on
-2. Next an XML HTTP request object is made by JavaScript
-3. XML HTTP request send a request to web server
-4. Server processed request & that is the server we're making the request of
-5. Server sends back a response to web page
-6. At other server the response is read by JavaScript
-7. Proper action, like page update, is performed by JavaScript

readyState properties
0 = request not initialized
1 = server connection established
2 = requests received
3 = processing requests
4 = requests finished and response is ready
