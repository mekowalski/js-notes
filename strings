String, a string or string literal, is series of zero or more characters in single/double quotes

var myName = 'Malind';

-Backslash helps to use quotes
var sentence = 'she repeated \'Can you hear me now?\''
return => "she repeated 'Can you hear me now?'"

-Concatenate, strings together, with plus operator
-Watch for spaces, concatenation does not add space between strings
var fullName = 'Malind ' + 'Kowalski';
return => Malind Kowalski

-Concatenate strings and variables
var sentence2 = 'My name is ' + fullName;
return => My name is Malind Kowalski

-Concatenate also with += operator, start with variable then add string
fullName += ' is my name';
return => Malind Kowalski is my name

-String values are immutable in Javascript
-Can't be altered once created
