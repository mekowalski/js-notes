Variable is container for value, value can be many things

1.Declare variable with var, const, let
var myName;

2.Initialize variable with =
myName = 'Malind';

3.Can declare & init all at once
var state = 'Colorado';

-Use variables all over the place in JS
console.log("My name is " + myName)

-Can update value by giving it a new value
state = 'New York'

-Naming rule and convention
0-9, a-z, A-Z
_ underscore at start has certain meaning, don't use it
# number at start can cause errors
camelCase should be used for naming variables
var bestDogEver = 'Caroga'

-Variable names should be intuitive and variables are case sensitive
var italianMeals = 'Spaghetti, Carbonara, Lasagna'

-Do not use JS reserve words
var, function, if, else, for

-Javascript is loosely typed language, doesn't need to specify data type such as number or string
